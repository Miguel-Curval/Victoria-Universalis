Victoria Universalis Mod

This mod was created to showcase a new feature that could dynamically target provinces or states for events and decisions. I removed almost all random events and replaced their effects with my new targeted decision system. It was made mostly from the ground up from vanilla with a few things included from other mods that I liked, namely the reforms and their associated localizations from HPM, two new goods and their art assets from PDM, and a few event files from various other mods.

The next step in creating this mod was to solve the liquidity crisis that plagued the economy in the base game due to numerous money sinks that destroy money instead of transferring it back into the market. I chose to make the pop growth bonus from healthcare reform based entirely on social spending funding and then make the reforms massively expensive in order to put money from national banks back into the hands of POPs. I know this isn't historical or realistic, but it rewards players for managing their economy well and leads to some interesting gameplay choices when combined with my new decision system.

Finally, being an avid player of multiplayer vicky 2 games, I wanted to create both a balanced singleplayer and multiplayer experience. You should still see a somewhat historical great powers ranking list in single player games, but I've given numerous buffs to smaller nations and uncivs that make them more fun to play. I've also reworked nearly all country specific events and decisions and made them more impactful.

Thanks to the creators of HPM and PDM for the reforms, localizations, and art assets. Thanks to God of Cheese for his RGO changing events in PIUR, which is what gave me the idea to create my new targeting system.
