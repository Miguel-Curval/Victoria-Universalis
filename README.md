# Victoria Universalis Mod

This mod completely reworks the gameplay of vanilla Victoria 2 and introduces entirely new mechanics, such as the ability to dynamically target provinces for province events and a national idea system that allows players to choose from a list of bonuses to their country.

The economy has been completely overhauled as well, with most RGO unemployment and economic crashes being eliminated by the addition of a world bank reserve. The world bank is an unplayable country that has banker POPs which have almost unlimited demand for RGO goods and an almost infinite gold income. These POPs will buy any excess RGO goods that get produced from the rest of the world, thereby eliminating unemployment due to overproduction of goods from the game. The world bank is set to always be last in the rankings, which forces their POPs to buy goods only after every other country has gotten a chance to buy goods.

Mine RGO output is now mostly determined by mine size, with every mine in the world only starting with between 5-30k max RGO size. Mining provinces with high populations won't necessarily output more goods than provinces with small populations anymore and provinces that historically had small populations but high output are now accurately represented.

Many flavor countries and decisions have been imported over from HPM, with the decisions and events being modified to be more impactful in terms of gameplay and faster in terms of game performance.
